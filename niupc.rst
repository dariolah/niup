NIUPC module consists of three 'include' files:
- libim_
- libcd_
- libiup_

NIUPC is split into mutiple files physically to have smaller files for documentation.
All includes are exported from NIUPC module and are used as single NIUPC module (usage: niupc.someSymbol).

Code is generated from IUP C header files with c2nim.
